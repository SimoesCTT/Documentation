RATIONALE
================================================================================

This software is released under a Freedom License because:

1. CENSORSHIP RESISTANCE: Free speech requires free tools
2. KNOWLEDGE PRESERVATION: Information should be unstoppable
3. HUMAN RIGHTS: Privacy and communication are fundamental
4. INNOVATION: Open systems accelerate progress
5. EQUITY: No one should be priced out of participating

The internet was meant to be decentralized. This software helps restore that
vision by making every user into infrastructure.

================================================================================
CONVERGENT TIME THEORY
================================================================================

CTT Mesh Network is built on Convergent Time Theory physics:
- Universal temporal constant α = 0.0302
- Resonance frequencies: 587kHz / 293.5kHz
- Prime resonance windows for node discovery
- Temporal signatures for cryptographic identity

The physics is real. The math is published. The technology works.

LEGAL POSITION
================================================================================

This software enables peer-to-peer communication. Like email, torrents, or
the web itself - it is neutral technology. Users are responsible for their
content and compliance with applicable laws.

We do not host content. We do not monitor users. We provide infrastructure
that is mathematically unstoppable because it has no center to attack.

If you use this for illegal purposes, that's on you, not the software or its
creators. The same way gun makers aren't liable for crimes, phone companies
aren't liable for phone scams, and car companies aren't liable for drunk driving.

This is a tool. A good tool. A free tool. Use it responsibly.

================================================================================

By using this software, you acknowledge:
- You understand it's a neutral communication tool
- You're responsible for your use and content
- You will comply with applicable laws
- You accept there is no warranty
- You won't blame the creators for your choices

================================================================================
FREEDOM FOR ALL
================================================================================

This software is a gift to humanity.

From journalists exposing corruption,
To scientists sharing research,
To activists fighting oppression,
To students learning freely,
To anyone who believes information should be unstoppable.

No fees. No registration. No restrictions.

Just download, run, and join the mesh.
