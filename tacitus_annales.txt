TACITUS - ANNALES
Liber I, Caput I-IV

I. Urbem Romam a principio reges habuere; libertatem et consulatum L. Brutus instituit. dictaturae ad tempus sumebantur; neque decemviralis potestas ultra biennium, neque tribunorum militum consulare ius diu valuit. non Cinnae, non Sullae longa dominatio; et Pompei Crassique potentia cito in Caesarem, Lepidi atque Antonii arma in Augustum cessere, qui cuncta discordiis civilibus fessa nomine principis sub imperium accepit.

Sed veteris populi Romani prospera vel adversa claris scriptoribus memorata sunt; temporibusque Augusti dicendis non defuere decora ingenia, donec gliscente adulatione deterrerentur. Tiberii Gaique et Claudii ac Neronis res florentibus ipsis ob metum falsae, postquam occiderant, recentibus odiis compositae sunt.

Inde consilium mihi pauca de Augusto et extrema tradere, mox Tiberii principatum et cetera, sine ira et studio, quorum causas procul habeo.

II. Postquam Bruto et Cassio caesis nulla iam publica arma, Pompeius apud Siciliam oppressus exutoque Lepido, interfecto Antonio ne Iulianis quidem partibus nisi Caesar dux reliquus, posito triumviri nomine consulem se ferens et ad tuendam plebem tribunicio iure contentum, ubi militem donis, populum annona, cunctos dulcedine otii pellexit, insurgere paulatim, munia senatus magistratuum legum in se trahere, nullo adversante, cum ferocissimi per acies aut proscriptione cecidissent, ceteri nobilium, quanto quis servitio promptior, opibus et honoribus extollerentur ac novis ex rebus aucti tuta et praesentia quam vetera et periculosa mallent.

Neque provinciae illam rerum condicionem abnuebant, suspecto senatus populique imperio ob certamina potentium et avaritiam magistratuum, invalido legum auxilio quae vi ambitu postremo pecunia turbabantur.

III. At Romae ruere in servitium consules, patres, eques. quanto quis inlustrior, tanto magis falsi ac festinantes, vultuque composito, ne laeti excessu principis neu tristiores primordio, lacrimas gaudium, questus adulationem miscebant.

IV. Primae Augusti curationes Agrippam Maecenatem habuerunt, duces belli Drusumque et Tiberium; neque Galliarum Hispaniarumve aut Macedoniae Achaiaeque partes abnuebant; deletae Africae victoriae; pace comperta Parthorum.

TRANSLATION:

I. Rome at the beginning was ruled by kings. Freedom and the consulship were established by Lucius Brutus. Dictatorships were held for a temporary crisis. The power of the decemvirs did not last beyond two years, nor did the consular jurisdiction of the military tribunes endure long. The despotisms of Cinna and Sulla were brief; the rule of Pompey and Crassus soon yielded before Caesar; the arms of Lepidus and Antony before Augustus, who, when the world was wearied by civil strife, subjected it to empire under the title of Prince.

But the successes and reverses of the old Roman people have been recorded by famous historians; and fine intellects were not wanting to describe the times of Augustus, till growing sycophancy scared them away. The histories of Tiberius, Gaius, Claudius, and Nero, while they were in power, were falsified through terror, and after their death were written under the irritation of a recent hatred.

Hence my purpose is to relate a few facts about Augustus—more particularly his last acts—then the reign of Tiberius, and all which follows, without either bitterness or partiality, from any motives to which I am far removed.

II. After Brutus and Cassius were slain, there was no longer any army of the Republic. Pompey was crushed in Sicily, and with Lepidus pushed aside and Antony slain, even the Julian party had no leader left except Caesar. Dropping the title of triumvir, and giving out that he was simply a consul, and would be satisfied with a tribune's authority for the protection of the people, Augustus won over the soldiers with gifts, the populace with cheap grain, and all men with the sweets of repose, and so grew greater by degrees, while he concentrated in himself the functions of the Senate, the magistrates, and the laws. He was wholly unopposed, for the boldest spirits had fallen in battle, or in the proscription, while the remaining nobles, the readier they were to be slaves, were raised the higher by wealth and promotion, so that, aggrandized by revolution, they preferred the safety of the present to the dangerous past.

Nor did the provinces dislike that condition of affairs, for they distrusted the government of the Senate and the people, because of the rivalries between the leading men and the rapacity of the officials, while the protection of the laws was unavailing, as they were continually deranged by violence, intrigue, and finally by corruption.

III. At Rome people rushed into slavery—consuls, senators, knights. The higher a man's rank, the more eager his hypocrisy, and his looks the more carefully studied, so as neither to betray joy at the death of one emperor nor sorrow at the rise of another, while he mingled delight and lamentations, flattery and complaints.

IV. Augustus' first assistants were Agrippa and Maecenas, his generals Drusus and Tiberius. The provinces of Gaul, Spain, Macedonia, and Achaia did not refuse their part. Africa's victories were complete; peace was secured with the Parthians.
