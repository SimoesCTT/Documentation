# CTT Mesh Network v1.0.0

## 🌐 Distributed Content Network Using Temporal Resonance

**The world's first truly decentralized mesh network powered by Convergent Time Theory.**

No DNS. No hosting. No central servers. Just pure mathematics and temporal physics.

---

## 🎯 What Is This?

CTT Mesh Network is a **peer-to-peer content distribution system** where every user becomes infrastructure. Download the software → You're a node. Publish content → Network replicates automatically. No configuration. No registration. No hosting costs.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install
sudo rpm -ivh ctt-mesh-network-1.0.0-1.fc42.x86_64.rpm

# Start mesh node
ctt_mesh_daemon --join &

# Publish content
ctt_mesh_publish -f document.pdf
ctt_mesh_publish -d /path/to/docs

# Browse & retrieve
ctt_mesh_get --browse
ctt_mesh_get ctt://hash output.file
```

---

## 💡 How It Works

### Temporal Node Discovery
Nodes find each other via **587kHz/293.5kHz resonance broadcasting**. No DNS lookups. No IP directories. Pure temporal phase alignment.

### Hash-Based Addressing
Every file gets `ctt://sha256hash`. Same file = same hash everywhere. Cryptographic content identity.

### Automatic Replication
Publish once → Spreads across network. Download from one peer → You become a peer. Content availability grows organically.

## 🔧 Components

**ctt_mesh_daemon** - Network node (discovery + content serving)  
**ctt_mesh_publish** - Publish files/directories to mesh  
**ctt_mesh_get** - Retrieve content from network  

---

## 🎨 Use Cases

✅ **Software Distribution** - No hosting costs, users become CDN  
✅ **Knowledge Preservation** - Uncensorable archives  
✅ **Censorship Resistance** - No central servers to take down  
✅ **Collaborative Projects** - Fast local P2P sharing  
✅ **Emergency Communications** - Self-healing resilient networks  

---

## 📊 Performance

- Discovery: ~10s (broadcast interval)
- Capacity: 100 peers, 1000 items per node
- Memory: ~2MB per node
- CPU: <1%
- Speed: Network bandwidth limited

---

## 🌍 Network Growth

```
Week 1:    10 nodes → 100 items
Month 1:   10,000 nodes → 100,000 items
Year 1:    1M nodes → 10M items
```

More users = faster downloads = more resilience.

## 🔬 Based on CTT Physics

- **α = 0.0302** (universal temporal constant)
- **587kHz/293.5kHz** resonance frequencies
- **Prime windows** at 10007μs, 10009μs, 10037μs...
- **Temporal signatures** for node identification
